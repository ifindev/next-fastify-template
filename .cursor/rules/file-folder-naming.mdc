# File and Folder Naming Guide

- Always use kebab-case naming for all file and folder
- Use plurals for folder naming. 
```
// Correct folder naming
- controllers
- services
- utils

// Incorrect folder naming
- controller
- service
```
- Use `.folder-name` extension type for file naming
```
// Example correct folder naming
- auth.service.ts
- auth.middleware.ts
- test.util.ts

// Example inccorect folder naming
- auth.ts => doesn't convey what file is this
- auth.services.ts => don't use plural in extension
- authService.ts => DON'T USE camelCase!
```
